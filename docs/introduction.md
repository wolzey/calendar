# Introduction

WCalendar is a simple calendar component created to break down the complexity of working with dates while also giving the flexibility to style in any way to work in any application. Other calendar components are opinionated on how they look. With WCalendar the styles are all overwritable if you do not want to use the default styles.

## How it works

When you import WCalendar into your project you have a choice to bring in the default styles or to write your own with just a few classnames.
